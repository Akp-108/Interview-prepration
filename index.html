    <h1><li> Oue-1.What is React? What are its features</li></h1>
        <ol>
            <li>React was created by jordane  walke, a software engineer a software in facebook in the year 2011 and it was first deployed in the facebook news feed and later it was used in whats app and instargram </li>
        </ol>
         React is open source front end javascript library.
         <ol>
             <li>It follows the commoponet based approch for bulding reusebale UI compoent. specially for single page applicaton and it is used for developing interarive view layer of web and mobile applications </li>
             <li>Virtuel Dom</li>
             <li>One way data bunding</li>
             <li>reusebale Componet</li>
             <li>JSX(javascript syntax extantion)</li>
             <li>Performance</li>
         </ol>
         <h2><li>Que2--Explain Virtual DOM</li></h2>
         <ol>
             <li>Dom stands for document object model and it present the logical struture of our documnent.</li>
             <li>DOM is a document object model, created by converting HTML CSS and JS Real DOM, which is an object which gets created whenever any React application gets loaded on the screen for the first time., whenever React components gets mounted on the screen for the first time. Now when any user makes any changes on the screen like button click because of which the state variable will get updated so in this case the changes will not directly go to Real DOM , instead in react we have concept known Virtual DOM. So we are having two virtual doms, one virtual dom gets created at the time of mounting of react component so it is a copy of your real dom. Another virtual dom is the dom which contains the new changes, updated state variables values. Now these two virtual doms will get compared with each other and will check for the new changes. this complete procedure is known as diffing algorithm. Now the new changes will be updated in your Real dom. this procedure is known as Recoinciliation.</li>

             <li>example-- the colormoon technologies are made by using DOM only</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Oue.3--Diffing Algoritm</h3>
         <li>Now When any Dom is manipulated then currnet virtual dom layer compare it self with the previous virtual dom layer and uptared only the not mathcing DOM element ()</li>
         <h3></h3>
         <ol>

             <li>Libraby is a set of reusable function used by computer program and framwork is a pices of code that dictates the architecute of a project</li>
             <li>in library code calls the library but in framework , framwork calls the code</li>
             <li>In library we can control the data flow we can control the data flow by the methods but iN frame works we dont have any control of the data flow frame woks decide HOW the data will flow that is nothing but framework class code </li>
             <li>in preforance wise react is having higher performance over angular and view and community support
             </li>
             <li>react is having easy learnig curve and react ia havig SPA(SINGLE PAGE APPLICATION)</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Oue--4--What is the diff between class and functional components? why we are moving towards functional comp ?</h3>
         <ol>
             <li> in we Class uses  are having react lifecycles metheods and in function we are having hooks </li>
             <li>functional comp are also called statelss and class comp is called statefull</li>
             <li>no rander() function is function component</li>
             <li>functional component accepts props as an arguments but class component we have accept props and state both  </li>
             <li>function como are easty to read they have less code but the class commoponet have complox code strucute  and head to write</li>
             <li> in class compoent we uses the "this" keyword but i functional we dont need the keyword</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>statefull and stateless</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>the state less componet does not hold or manage   state</li>
             <li>the state full componet can   hold or manage   state</li>
             <li>stateless compoent is simple and easy to understand whrer as statefull comp is complex in copare to stateless component</li>
             <li>state less does ont work with react life cycles but where as statefull can work with any lifecycles methods and hooks </li>
             <li>staeless compoent can not be reused but statefull can be reused</li>
             <li>passing props come uder stateless coponet </li>
             <li>stateless compoent is also khown as functional compoent and statefull is khown as class component</li>
         </ol>
         <h3>Que--6--What are the different phases of React componentâ€™s lifecycle?</h3>
         <ol>
             <li>
                In ReactJS, every component creation process involves various lifecycle methods. These lifecycle methods are termed as component's lifecycle. These lifecycle methods are not very complicated and called at various points during a component's life. The lifecycle of the component is divided into four phases. They are:
                1.	Initial Phase
                2.	Mounting Phase
                3.	Updating Phase
                4.	Unmounting Phase
                Each phase contains some lifecycle methods that are specific to the particular phase
                
             </li>
         </ol>
